## :scroll: Description
A basic countdown timer with a focus on animations and managing state made by a junior android dev (my first time using compose)


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I'm really proud of how I managed the state. Each composable function (minus text inputs) 
are stateless and don't depend on any Android dependencies. I'm a junior Android dev, and I found
after completing the code labs on compose state and this challenge, 
I understand view models, livedata sooo much better.
